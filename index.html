                In the 2020s, fully autonomous constellations of mass produced, modest aperture UV and IR telescopes
                could bring to space-based astronomical research many of the same benefits that have been provided by
                arrays and networks of autonomous ground-based visual-wavelength telescopes. These constellations
                would not only expand the space research opportunities of professional astronomers, from graduate students to faculty, 
                but thanks to economies of quantity production and their autonomous operation, could also
                open up research opportunities for undergraduate students and citizen scientists in a manner similar to
                what has already occurred with autonomous ground-based systems.

                    A predecessor workshop, <a href="https://www.in4star.org/2020-cubesat-presentation-slides">CubeSat Astronomy in the 2020s</a>, was held on January 4, 2020, at the American
                    Astronomical Society’s winter meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii. The 70+ attendees were a mix of university
                    and NASA scientists, engineers, and commercial company representatives, as well as a sizable contingent
                    of published undergraduate and high school student and citizen scientist researchers.
                    <br><br>

                Advances in technology, quantity production of components, lower launch costs, and wide-band
                communications should help create a synergistic balance between large and small telescopes in space.
                Constellations of fully autonomous UV and IR CubeSat telescopes in space could provide time series
                photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of interesting objects identified by larger space
                and ground survey telescopes. Together, these telescopes could form a synergistic, efficient whole.
                If the cost of one of the constellations was low enough, it could become affordable for undergraduate and
                high school student research teams, as well as citizen scientists. When it comes to sports, everyone gets
                it; you have to play to learn what the game is all about. It would be ludicrous to teach basketball by
                practicing layups, free throws, and jump shots, but never play any actual games. Students, at the outset
                of their educational careers, benefit from conducting actual research. What could be more inspiring to
                potential STEM-career students, including women and minoritized groups, than being a coauthor of a published
                paper based on space telescope observations?
                <br><br>

                The workshop will consider:
                <ul>
                <li>Consolidating research requirements with respect for specific constellations locations, apertures,
                wavelengths, and sensors</li> 
                <li> Timing of constellation deployments (should a small UV imaging constellation be first?)</li>
                <li> Designing constellations to be fully autonomous </li> 
                <li> Efficiently producing constellation telescopes in quantity </li>
                <li> Standardizing hardware and software interfaces to facilitate interchangeable modular components
                across constellations </li>
                <li> Dedicating a low-cost constellation to student and citizen science research </li>
                </ul>
                And suggest how we can move forward:
                <ul>
                <li> Scientists will need to group similar research programs in a manner that would allow them to be
                carried out by constellations that meet the needs of most researchers </li>
                <li> Industry will need to set standards, conduct feasibility studies, and provide cost estimates </li>
                <li> Educators, students, and citizen scientists will need to organize themselves in preparation for
                affordable access to space telescopes </li>
                </ul>
                History could repeat itself. Astronomical research began with small telescopes, but soon shifted to everlarger mountaintop telescopes. The microcomputer revolution led to arrays and networks of modestaperture, off-the-shelf, fully autonomous telescopes appearing on mountaintops. They complimented the
                larger telescopes in a synergistic manner. Time on these autonomous telescopes became so affordable
                that published research by undergraduate students, high school students, and citizen scientists
                blossomed. Constellations of affordable, autonomousspace telescopes could, in a similar manner, lead to
                the democratization of space telescope research.

            </div>
            <h3> Saturday, June 11 </h3>
            <h4> 1. NASA Headquarters Overviews </h4>
            CubeSat and SmallSat Astrophysics (Michael Garcia, Science Mission Directorate, Astrophysics)<br>
            Small Spacecraft Technology and Access to Space (Florence Tan, Deputy Chief Technologist) <br>
            Science, STEM Education, and Citizen Science (Kristen Erickson, Science Engagement and Partnerships) <br>

            <h4> 2. UV Science, Sensors, and Systems (Chair: Paul Scowen, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)</h4>
            The potential economies of scale that could eventually be offered by constellations of identical space
            telescopes will necessitate consolidating the research needs across a wide range and large number of
            users to match a limited number of general-purpose telescopes. There might, for instance be a large
            constellation of small (CubeSat) UV imaging telescopes, and a smaller constellation of larger (SmallSat)
            UV spectroscopic telescopes. This session will consider research opportunities for UV constellations, the
            sensors they might employ, and current and future complete UV systems.

            <h4> 3. IR Science, Sensors and Systems (Chair: Duncan Farrah, University of Hawaii) </h4>
            While it is conceivable that some future constellation telescopes might make observations across UV,
            visual, and IR wavelengths, it seems likely that the requirements for sensor and even telescope cooling
            may result in separate IR constellations with different telescopes, orbits, etc. Similar to the UV session,
            the IR session will consider how IR science research opportunities might be consolidated, and the status
            of current and future sensors and total systems. Special consideration will be given to both active and  
            passive cooling systems. As future launch cost plummet, would it, for instance, make sense to place a
            constellation of passively cooled SmallSat IR telescopes beyond Earth orbit?

            <h3>Sunday, June 12</h3>
            <h4>4. Scaling Up to Constellations (Co-Chairs: Russell Genet, California Polytechnic State University,
             and Aaron Tohuvavohu, University of Toronto) </h4>
            A useful telescope economic metric is total life cycle cost per observing hour. Costs can be reduced
            through design, modularization, standardization of buses, economies of production scale, reusable
            launch vehicles, low-cost broadband communications, and fully autonomous operation. Observing hours
            can be increased through improved reliability, the percentage of the time making observations, and
            longer useful lifetimes through higher orbits or propulsion. This session will consider how the life cycle
            costs of future constellations could be reduced and their observing time increased.

            <h4>5. New Users and Coordination (Chair: Rachel Freed, Institute for Student Astronomical Research)</h4>
            Mass production and autonomous operation of constellations of UV and IR CubeSat and SmallSat
            telescopes could foster student and citizen science research as well as STEM education, helping to
            "democratize" space. Presumably, these new (to space) classes of users will primarily utilize the most
            economical (cost/hour) constellations, such as CubeSat UV imaging. Organizations such as the American
            Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), the Institute for Student Astronomical Research
            (InStAR), and the Society for Astronomical Sciences (SAS) have been using remote autonomous ground
            telescopes for years. This session will consider how these new classes of users and their organizations
            could be integrated into space research.

            <h4>6. Way Forward Panel Discussion (Chair: Michael Garcia, Science Mission Directorate, Astrophysics)</h4>
            The final session will consider how, over the coming decade, academic, governmental, and industrial
            organizations could work together to make economical, autonomous space telescope constellations a
            reality. Consideration will be given to establishing informal working groups that mirror the workshop’s
            sessions: UV science, IR science, economic constellations, and new users.

            In person participation requires that attendees must be registered for the AAS meeting whether or not they attend any of the
            rest of the meeting. <br>
            There is no workshop only registration (the AAS workshops are priced low for this
            reason). 
            Workshop-only attendees need to at least register for one day or whatever option suits them
            and is the cheapest, e.g., student registration is cheaper than one day registration for students. <br>
            Please
            register <a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas240/registration">at this link</a>, 
            and be sure to add the workshop ($35 USD) to your registration cart.
